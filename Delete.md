An automation framework for commodity trade booking can help to reduce dependency on front office systems by automating the process of entering trade information and executing trades. This can include using software to automatically enter trade details, such as prices, quantities, and counterparty information, as well as automatically sending trade confirmations and executing trades. The automation framework can also include various checks and controls to ensure that trades are executed correctly and in compliance with regulations. Overall, an automation framework can help to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and increase compliance in the commodity trade booking process.
